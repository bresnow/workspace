# This Is How My Brand Is Built.

Behold mofos. 

Here is all the configuration files to my Docker Swarm cluster, open source web services, bash scripts, and sleepless weeks I have (and contnue to) put into my brand Bresnow Design Studio. 

It's mostly learning as I go. Tailor fitting Docker images, and stack files to build what I have been dreaming about for the past 10 years. 

I'll be updating this README as i go along to give more insight to whats going on here. Unmtil then... If you know you know.
